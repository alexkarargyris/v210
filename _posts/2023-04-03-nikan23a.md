title: Appearance-Based Gaze Estimation for Driver Monitoring
abstract: Driver inattention is a leading cause of road accidents through its impact
  on reaction time in the face of incidents. In the case of Level-3 (L3) vehicles,
  inattention adversely impacts the quality of driver take over and therefore the
  safe performance of L3 vehicles. There is a high correlation between a driver’s
  visual attention and eye movement. Gaze angle is an excellent surrogate for assessing
  driver attention zones, in both cabin interior and on-road scenarios. We propose
  appearance-based gaze estimation approaches using convolutional neural networks
  (CNNs) to estimate gaze angle directly from eye images and also from eye landmark
  coordinates. The goal is to improve learning by utilizing synthetic data with more
  accurate annotations. Performance analysis shows that our proposed landmark-based
  model, trained synthetically, is capable of predicting gaze angle in the real data
  with a reasonable angular error. In addition, we discuss evaluation metrics are
  application specific and there is a crucial requirement for a more reliable assessment
  metric rather than common mean angular error to measure the driver’s gaze direction
  in L3 autonomy for a control takeover request at a proper time corresponding to
  the driver’s attention focus to avoid ambiguities.
