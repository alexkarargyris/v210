title: Federated Learning for Appearance-based Gaze Estimation in the Wild
abstract: Gaze estimation methods have significantly matured in recent years, but
  the large number of eye images required to train deep learning models poses significant
  privacy risks. In addition, the heterogeneous data distribution across different
  users can significantly hinder the training process. In this work, we propose the
  first federated learning approach for gaze estimation to preserve the privacy of
  gaze data. We further employ pseudo-gradient optimisation to adapt our federated
  learning approach to the divergent model updates to address the heterogeneous nature
  of in-the-wild gaze data in collaborative setups. We evaluate our approach on a
  real-world dataset (MPIIGaze) and show that our work enhances the privacy guarantees
  of conventional appearance-based gaze estimation methods, handles the convergence
  issues of gaze estimators, and significantly outperforms vanilla federated learning
  by 15.8% (from a mean error of 10.63 degrees to 8.95 degrees). As such, our work
  paves the way to develop privacy-aware collaborative learning setups for gaze estimation
  while maintaining the model’s performance.
