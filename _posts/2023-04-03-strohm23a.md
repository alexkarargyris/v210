title: Facial Composite Generation with Iterative Human Feedback
abstract: 'We propose the first method in which human and AI collaborate to iteratively
  reconstruct the human’s mental image of another person’s face only from their eye
  gaze. Current tools for generating digital human faces involve a tedious and time-consuming
  manual design process. While gaze-based mental image reconstruction represents a
  promising alternative, previous methods still assumed prior knowledge about the
  target face, thereby severely limiting their practical usefulness. The key novelty
  of our method is a collaborative, it- erative query engine: Based on the user’s
  gaze behaviour in each iteration, our method predicts which images to show to the
  user in the next iteration. Results from two human studies (N=12 and N=22) show
  that our method can visually reconstruct digital faces that are more similar to
  the mental image, and is more usable compared to other methods. As such, our findings
  point at the significant potential of human-AI collaboration for recon- structing
  mental images, potentially also beyond faces, and of human gaze as a rich source
  of information and a powerful mediator in said collaboration.'
