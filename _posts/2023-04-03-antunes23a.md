title: Generating Attention Maps from Eye-gaze for the Diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease
abstract: 'Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are currently the best computational
  methods for the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) from neuroimaging. CNNs are
  able to automati- cally learn a hierarchy of spatial features, but they are not
  optimized to incorporate domain knowledge. In this work we study the generation
  of attention maps based on a human expert gaze of the brain scans (domain knowledge)
  to guide the deep model to focus on the more relevant regions for AD diagnosis.
  Two strategies to generate the maps from eye-gaze were investigated; the use of
  average class maps and supervising a network to generate the attention maps. These
  approaches were compared with masking (hard attention) with regions of interest
  (ROI) and CNNs with traditional attention mechanisms. For our experiments, we used
  positron emission tomography (PET) scans from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging
  Initiative (ADNI) database. For the task of normal control (NC) vs Alzheimer’s (AD),
  the best performing model was with insertion of regions of interest (ROI), which
  achieved 95.6% accuracy, 0.4% higher than the baseline CNN. Keywords: Deep learning;
  Alzheimer’s disease; Convolutional neural network; Attention mechanism; Eye tracking;
  Computer-aided diagnosis.'
