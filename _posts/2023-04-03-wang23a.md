title: 'SecNet: Semantic Eye Completion in Implicit Field'
abstract: If we take a depth image of an eye, noise artifacts and holes significantly
  affect the depth values on the eye due to the specularity of the sclera. This paper
  aims at solving this problem through semantic shape completion. We propose an end-to-end
  approach to train a neural network, called SecNet (semantic eye completion network),
  that predicts a point cloud with an accurate eye-geometry coupled with the semantic
  labels of each point. These labels correspond to the essential eye-regions, i.e.
  pupil, iris and sclera. Particularly, our work performs implicit estimation of the
  query points with semantic labels where both the semantic and occupancy predictions
  are trained in an end-to-end way. To evaluate the ap- proach, we then use the synthetic
  eye-scans rendered in UnityEyes simulator environment. Compared to the state of
  the art, the proposed method improves the accuracy for shape- completion for 3D
  eye-scan by 8.2%. In practice, we also demonstrate the application of our semantic
  eye completion for gaze estimation.
