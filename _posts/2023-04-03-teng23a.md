title: Skill, or Style? Classification of Fetal Sonography Eye-Tracking Data
abstract: We present a method for classifying human skill at fetal ultrasound scanning
  from eye- tracking and pupillary data of sonographers. Human skill characterization
  for this clinical task typically creates groupings of clinician skills such as expert
  and beginner based on the number of years of professional experience; experts typically
  have more than 10 years and beginners between 0-5 years. In some cases, they also
  include trainees who are not yet fully-qualified professionals. Prior work has considered
  eye movements that necessi- tates separating eye-tracking data into eye movements,
  such as fixations and saccades. Our method does not use prior assumptions about
  the relationship between years of experi- ence and does not require the separation
  of eye-tracking data. Our best performing skill classification model achieves an
  F1 score of 98% and 70% for expert and trainee classes re- spectively. We also show
  that years of experience as a direct measure of skill, is significantly correlated
  to the expertise of a sonographer.
