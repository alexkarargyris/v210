title: Integrating eye gaze into machine learning using fractal curves
abstract: 'Eye gaze tracking has traditionally employed a camera to capture a participant’s
  eye move- ments and characterise their visual fixations. However, gaze pattern recognition
  is still challenging. This is due to both gaze point sparsity, and a seemingly random
  approach participants take to viewing unfamiliar stimuli without a set task. Our
  paper proposes a method for integrating eye gaze into machine learning by con- verting
  a fixation’s two dimensional (x, y) coordinate into a one dimensional Hilbert curve
  distance metric, making it well suited for implementation into machine learning.
  We will compare this approach to a traditional grid-based string substitution technique,
  with an example implementation demonstrated in a Support Vector Machine and Convolutional
  Neural Network. Finally, a comparison will be made to examine what method performs
  better. Results have shown that this method can be both useful to dynamically quantise
  scan- paths for tuning statistical significance in large datasets, and to investigate
  the nuances of similarity found in shared bottom-up processing when participants
  observe unfamiliar stimuli in a free viewing experiment. Real world applications
  can include expertise-related eye gaze prediction, medical screening, and image
  saliency identification. Keywords: Neuroscience, eye tracking, fractals, support
  vector machine, convolutional neural network.'
