title: Learning to count visual objects by combining “what” and “where” in recurrent
  memory
abstract: Counting the number of objects in a visual scene is easy for humans but
  challenging for modern deep neural networks. Here we explore what makes this problem
  hard and study the neural computations that allow transfer of counting ability to
  new objects and contexts. Previous work has implicated posterior parietal cortex
  (PPC) in numerosity perception and in visual scene understanding more broadly. It
  has been proposed that action-related saccadic signals computed in PPC provide object-invariant
  information about the number and arrangement of scene elements, and may contribute
  to relational reasoning in visual displays. Here, we built a glimpsing recurrent
  neural network that combines gaze contents (“what”) and gaze location (“where”)
  to count the number of items in a visual array. The network successfully learns
  to count and generalizes to several out-of-distribution test sets, including images
  with novel items. Through ablations and comparison to control models, we establish
  the contribution of brain-inspired computational principles to this generalization
  ability. This work provides a proof-of-principle demonstration that a neural network
  that combines “what” and “where” can learn a generalizable concept of numerosity
  and points to a promising approach for other visual reasoning tasks.
