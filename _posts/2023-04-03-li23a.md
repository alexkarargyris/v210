title: Modeling Human Eye Movements with Neural Networks in a Maze-Solving Task
abstract: From smoothly pursuing moving objects to rapidly shifting gazes during visual
  search, humans employ a wide variety of eye movement strategies in different contexts.
  While eye movements provide a rich window into mental processes, building generative
  models of eye movements is notoriously difficult, and to date the computational
  objectives guiding eye movements remain largely a mystery. In this work, we tackled
  these problems in the context of a canonical spatial planning task, maze-solving.
  We collected eye movement data from human subjects and built deep generative models
  of eye movements using a novel differentiable architecture for gaze fixations and
  gaze shifts. We found that human eye movements are best predicted by a model that
  is optimized not to perform the task as efficiently as possible but instead to run
  an internal simulation of an object traversing the maze. This not only provides
  a generative model of eye movements in this task but also suggests a computational
  theory for how humans solve the task, namely that humans use mental simulation.
