title: Electrode Clustering and Bandpass Analysis of EEG Data for Gaze Estimation
abstract: In this study, we validate the findings of previously published papers,
  showing the feasibility of an Electroencephalography (EEG) based gaze estimation.
  Moreover, we extend previous research by demonstrating that with only a slight drop
  in model performance, we can significantly reduce the number of electrodes, indicating
  that a high-density, expensive EEG cap is not necessary for the purposes of EEG-based
  eye tracking. Using data-driven approaches, we establish which electrode clusters
  impact gaze estimation and how the different types of EEG data preprocessing affect
  the models’ performance. Finally, we also inspect which recorded frequencies are
  most important for the defined tasks.
