title: 'Selection of XAI Methods Matters: Evaluation of Feature Attribution Methods
  for Oculomotoric Biometric Identification'
abstract: Substantial advances in oculomotoric biometric identification have been
  made due to deep neural networks processing non-aggregated time series data that
  replace methods processing theoretically motivated engineered features. However,
  interpretability of deep neural networks is not trivial and needs to be thoroughly
  investigated for future eye tracking applications. Especially in medical or legal
  applications explanations can be required to be provided alongside predictions.
  In this work, we apply several attribution methods to a state of the art model for
  eye movement-based biometric identification. To asses the quality of the generated
  attributions, this work is focused on the quantitative evaluation of a range of
  established metrics. We find that Layer-wise Relevance Propagation generates the
  least complex attributions, while DeepLIFT attributions are the most faithful. Due
  to the absence of a correlation between attributions of these two methods we advocate
  to consider both methods for their potentially complementary attributions.
